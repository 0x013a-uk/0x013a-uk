🟢 This structure works, and the names are clear. I’d tighten the blurbs, keep them “vision-mode” (no IP), and make the repos feel like a cohesive suite.

Below are polished one-liners and README stubs you can paste in. I’ve kept wording consistent with your brand: local, sovereign, verifiable.

Repo names + blurbs (tight)

Hqllr — Document Indexer
A lightning-fast, local-first knowledge indexer: atomises documents, eliminates duplication, and prepares data for instant, verifiable search.

HqllrAI — AI Re-Invented
An adaptive query engine on top of Hqllr Indexer: persona-aware answers with provenance, designed for truth over hype.

HqllrOS — Hqllr Operating System
A RAM-orchestrated, sovereign runtime for Hqllr clusters: simple deployment, replication, and audit-ready federation.


> If you want tighter naming consistency, consider: hqllr-indexer, hqllr-ai, hqllr-os (lowercase, hyphenated) — good for CLI/package/distribution.

README templates (copy/paste)

1) Hqllr (Indexer)

README.md

# Hqllr — Document Indexer
*A lightning-fast, local-first knowledge indexer.*

Hqllr transforms raw documents into compact, deduplicated knowledge ready for instant search and verifiable answers.

## Why Hqllr
- **Local & Sovereign** — runs offline; your data stays yours.
- **Atomised & Deduped** — stores only what’s unique; saves space and time.
- **Instantly Searchable** — built for rapid lookups at any scale.
- **Provenance-Ready** — designed so downstream answers can cite and verify.

## Status
> **Preview** – architecture and APIs here are high-level; core internals are private while we harden the engine.
- Public demos, schemas, and examples will land first.
- Full ingest features will appear in staged releases.

## Get Started (Preview)
- Examples: `examples/` show how to prepare data and query mock indices.
- CLI (preview): `hqllr --help` *(when published)*

## Roadmap
- [ ] Preview demos & mock datasets
- [ ] Public CLI (read-only)
- [ ] SDK bindings (Dart/Go/Python)
- [ ] Private ingest beta (early access)

## Security & Privacy
- Built for offline/sovereign use. No telemetry by default.
- See `SECURITY.md` and `PRIVACY.md`.

## License
- Source-available preview license (non-production). Commercial licensing on request.

2) HqllrAI (Query Engine)

README.md

# HqllrAI — AI Re-Invented
*Adaptive, persona-aware answers on top of Hqllr Indexer.*

HqllrAI delivers fact-first responses with clear provenance. Personas tailor language and depth for learners, professionals, and experts.

## Key Ideas
- **Persona-Adaptive** — speak to a child, a grad, or a PhD with one switch.
- **Fact-First** — answers link back to their origins.
- **Local-First** — works offline against local indices.
- **Composable** — plug in your own corpora and policies.

## Status
> **Preview** – public policies, schemas, and demo UIs ship first; core retrieval logic remains private while we validate.

## What’s Included (Preview)
- Persona policy examples (JSON)
- Demo Q→A flows using mock datasets
- UI prototypes for mobile/desktop

## Roadmap
- [ ] Demo app (queries without ingest)
- [ ] Persona editor (policies)
- [ ] Provenance UI (hashes, sources)
- [ ] Early access SDKs

## License
- Source-available preview license; commercial use requires agreement.

3) HqllrOS (Runtime)

README.md

# HqllrOS — Hqllr Operating System
*A sovereign runtime for Hqllr clusters.*

HqllrOS orchestrates local/edge nodes with simple deployment, fast replication, and audit-ready federation.

## Highlights
- **RAM-First Orchestration** — fast boots, fast rebuilds.
- **Simple Replication** — consensus-backed, append-only semantics.
- **Federation Controls** — share nothing or share selectively, per namespace.
- **Ops Minimalism** — KISS: built for small teams and strict environments.

## Status
> **Preview** – images, manifests, and tooling specs are staged here; base OS images and hardening guides follow for early access testers.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Node images (preview)
- [ ] Cluster bootstrap scripts
- [ ] Federation policies
- [ ] Observability pack

## License
- Source-available preview license; production use under commercial terms.

Top-level “Project Hub” (optional)

Create a meta-repo (e.g., hqllr/hqllr) that links to all three and houses the vision whitepaper + demo links.

README.md

# Hqllr — Local. Sovereign. Verifiable.
*A Hall of knowledge. The guardian of truth.*

- **[Hqllr — Indexer](../Hqllr)** — ingest & index (local-first)
- **[HqllrAI — Query Engine](../HqllrAI)** — persona-aware, fact-first answers
- **[HqllrOS — Runtime](../HqllrOS)** — sovereign cluster orchestration

## Whitepaper
- [Download the Hqllr Vision Paper](./whitepaper/Hqllr-Vision.pdf)

## Demos
- Preview app (mobile/web) – coming soon
- Teaser videos – coming soon

## Community
- Discussions: enabled here
- Matrix/Discord: coming soon
